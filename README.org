#+TITLE: Emacs mode for the TimeLines live coding language
There are two things here:
1. An Emacs major mode for creating and interacting with a live TimeLines
   session.
2. (What I consider to be) A set of sensible default settings and packages to
   get someone started with Emacs, together with a mini tutorial.
** Installation
*** Emacs Config
If you are new to Emacs and want to get started quickly, clone this repo by executing
**** Linux & OS X
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/lnfiniteMonkeys/TimeLines-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d~
#+END_SRC
**** Windows
#+BEGIN_SRC git clone
setx HOME ^%HOMEDRIVE^%^%HOMEPATH^%
git clone https://github.com/lnfiniteMonkeys/TimeLines-emacs.git %HOME%\.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
If there is a ~.emacs~ file in your home directory then delete it.
*** timelines-mode
If you already have an Emacs config and just want to use this mode, clone
this repo in a directory, for example ~git clone https://github.com/lnfiniteMonkeys/TimeLines-emacs.git
~/timelines-emacs~, and add the following lines to your init file, replacing the paths respectively:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load "~/path/to/timelines-mode.el")
(setq timelines-path "~/path/to/timelines/source")
#+END_SRC
